						A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Known for its simplicity and
						flexibility, Vue’s component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable, modular components that keep the codebase
						organized and maintainable. Vue’s reactive data binding, Composition API, and support for TypeScript make it suitable for complex
						applications, while its lightweight core and extensive ecosystem enable both small and large-scale projects. Vue is widely appreciated
						for its developer-friendly approach and powerful features. Utilizing Vue 3’s Composition API, TypeScript integration,
						and modular component design, I deliver front-end applications that seamlessly integrate with backend services. My approach
						emphasizes performance, flexibility, and maintainability, ensuring that each application is optimized for a consistent user
						experience across all devices.

						A powerful, statically-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, adding a layer of reliability and robustness
						to web development. By introducing optional static types, TypeScript enables developers to catch errors early in the development process,
						making code more predictable and easier to debug. With strong support for object-oriented programming, interfaces, and advanced tooling,
						TypeScript provides a structured approach to JavaScript that enhances code readability, reusability, and scalability, especially in larger
						projects. Ideal for both front-end and back-end development, TypeScript integrates seamlessly with frameworks like Vue and React, offering
						a solid foundation for building high-quality, maintainable applications.

						principles and being able to translate design mockups into functional code. Additionally, frontend development includes working with state management, client-side routing, and interacting
						with backend APIs to dynamically update content and improve the overall user experience. Being proficient in frontend development means having the ability to build the visual structure of
						an application while ensuring that it is intuitive, fast, and accessible.

						Backend development is the skill of building and maintaining the server-side infrastructure that powers web applications. It involves writing server-side code in languages such as Python, Java,
						Node.js, or Ruby to handle business logic, database operations, and communication between systems. Backend developers work with databases (SQL or NoSQL), manage user authentication, and ensure
						that the application’s architecture can scale to handle increasing traffic. This skill also involves building and managing APIs to connect the frontend with backend services. Backend developers
						ensure that applications run efficiently, securely, and reliably. They optimize performance, handle data processing, and implement error handling and security protocols, such as encryption and
						secure data storage. Mastery of backend development requires both technical expertise and the ability to architect systems that are scalable, secure, and capable of delivering seamless user experiences.

					<template v-slot:skillDescription>
						API integration is the skill of connecting different software systems through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow them to share data and functionality. In modern application development,
						APIs are a fundamental skill as they enable interaction with third-party services, such as payment gateways, social media platforms, messaging services, and cloud storage solutions. API integration
						involves understanding how to send and receive data between systems, handle errors, and ensure the integration is secure and efficient. This skill is essential for adding external functionalities to an
						application without having to reinvent the wheel, allowing developers to leverage existing services to enhance the application’s capabilities. API integration also requires knowledge of protocols such as
						REST and GraphQL, as well as authentication methods like OAuth. Being proficient in API integration means being able to seamlessly connect systems and services, extending the functionality of an application
						while ensuring smooth and secure interactions with external systems.
